1. Individual chamber hours and program hours is calculated based on specified time period.
- Go through chamber hours table, search log timestamps add up the hours based on date specified

2. What DARs, chambers, cages are being used?
- View active tests and select the equipment assigned


3. When assigning DARs/chambers/cage, be able to see information about these items.
- Add information columns to equipment tables

4. Know what technicians are available, skills of technicians.
- display list of technicians and their skills (column in technician table), search for active tests they are assigned to.

5. History of DUTs (test ran on it, information about those tests, received time).
- many-to-many relationship between Tests and DUTs, showing the pairs of Test and DUTs that went with each other.


7. View comments on specific dates, remove need to input dates for each comment.
- Search for timestamps based on condition

8. Let supervisors make comments on each chamber.
- Create a column in chamber hours table for comments


9. Chambers have multiple circuits (6 max), and we need to know the hours of those circuits, and comments for each circuit.
- First Method: Can add in columns in chamber log table for each one (this can result in a lot of NUll values if not all 
chambers have circuits. Each unused circuit is 3 unused NULL entries. If only one circuit is used, this method
will have 15 unused entries compared to second method. This method also fixes the number of circuits we can enter
data for at 6 circuits, whereas the other method can have as many as we want.)

Second Method: We can put in comment columns, hours and circuit number columns for a single circuit in each log. (This can put 4 extra
FK data entries for each circuit. If all circuits are used, we have 24 extra entries than other method)


10. Need to know which equipment can be used for a certain product (they are intended for certain products only).
- Add in association table for products and equipment

11. Need to know when equipment are available based on scheduling (target start, end dates; actual start, end dates in test table).
- Add in targeted start and end dates and schedule based on these dates

12. Need to know the circuits that DUTs have been in for each test.
- Add in a circuit number that each DUT was in in the Test-DUT association table
