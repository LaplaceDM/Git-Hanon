Harness
- get from harness list 
- harness hours will get from chamber log.
*only average resistance needed?
*added a date column to track current location of harness

Laptops
- laptop list
*how many 8gbs needed is not included
*model vs. model number?
*win10 upgradable?
*memory upgrade date?


DAR
- Dar list: J:\NATC Test & Prototype Lab\44. Reporting Data\GVV DAR List for Database
- dont need: non-highlighted
*will identify channels uniquely
-move variants to product table

Chambers
- chamber list + table David sent
*have a "test" table to know the compatibility of DARs with tests?- yes
* have working condition for dars too?
*cooling column meaning?

Products
- Name
- platform
- communication protocol
- Voltage level
- Fluid type (to see if grounding is needed for dielectric oil)
*will list out fluid pairs instead of storing in one column


Programs
- WBS number
- variants (one program may have mutiple variants)
- OEM

Fluids
- Specification (Name)
- manufacturer
- storage location
- OEM (car company)
*are OEM the companies whose pumps we are using the fluids on? _ match fluids with programs

Cages
- cage id
- program
- number of DUTs it can hold
- OEM (car company)
*OEM already comes with program name

Technicians
- Lab
 *

DUTs
- know what tests its assigned to, completion of those tests.
- storage date
- storage bin number (long term storage + anything else)
* do we need to lab table?
*added timestamp column to know the latest location of DUT

Chamber Logs:
- Time in timestamp
- everything in the log sheet,
except for part number
*will have a table for circuit logs, and one for the general info


Tests:
- Lab in which test is conducted
- schedule (complete, current,..)
- status (setup, stopped, running, data review,..)
- hours required for test to complete
*

Need to know how many hours we spend on running, setup, waiting product, not booked,
repair and maintenance

0- stopped
1- setup
2- running

*is accumulated hours only running time?
*can r&m be not booked? - unbillable
*set up and running and not booked can be calculated through status of chamber logs.
*waiting for test center is waiting to be booked? if yes, the waiting for test center hours can be current date
minus targeted start

running is accumulated hours, set up is difference in timestamps minus running if status is set to setup
not booked is difference in timestamps minus running if status is stopped
waiting product, maintenance can be put as a status for calculation.
or take status from test table that supervisors update.

- calculate set up time before logs begin?
*
running: accumulated hours
set up: setup date to first log, plus in-test setups - if status is set to setup, get difference in timestamps
minus difference in accumulated hours of the two logs.
not booked: if status is set to stopped, difference in timestamp and accumulated hours



- test type for chambers
- move variants to product table
- match fluids with programs
